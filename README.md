# Titanic-Learn_from_disaster
My attempt in the  Kaggle machine learning competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster".

The Titanic competition was my first attempt in the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Having a background in Physics and Biomedical Engineering it was a great opportunity to put my analytic skills to test and expand to the Data universe!

### Aim of the project
The aim of this project is to predict the survivors of the Titanic shipwreck using a train and a test dataset. Some of the features included in these datasets were the names, the age, the sex and the family makeup of the passengers. Based on the survival status provided in the train dataset, the survival status of the passengers had to be predicted (Non survivors: 0, Survivors:1).

### Credits
The code provided in this repo was influenced by other Kagglers taking part in this competition.
